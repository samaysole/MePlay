**MePlay** is created to play music, explore musics and also it helps create playlists for spotify.

ðŸ’¡ Research has shown that blood flows more easily when music is played. It can also reduce heart rate, lower blood pressure, decrease cortisol (stress hormone) levels and increase serotonin and endorphin levels in the blood. It elevates mood. Music can boost the brain's production of the hormone dopamine

## Story :book:

Meplay was born out of need to play musics of different catagories and create a playlist for spotify using spotify api. It helps an individual to play/recommend a set of songs based on their
favorite /likes and selection. It reduces the stress of going creating an entire afrobeat/
Afropop/drill playlist before you play your desired songs. This project allows for the exposure of the user to new music and enables the user to explore a variety of music based on their preferences. This project would enable artists to extend their reach and gain new listeners. End Users would be music listeners, radio stations, playlist curators, and music and tv presenters.  User preference is still needed, hence the project revolves around the end user based on their input and preferences.
